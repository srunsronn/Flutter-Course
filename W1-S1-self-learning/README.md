SELF-LEARNING 1 - Dart Syntax & Concepts
To assess your understanding, you need to complete and submit this handout on MS Team

Objectives
By completing this handout, you will: 1. Apply type inference for variable declarations. 2. Handle nullable and non-nullable variables. 3. Differentiate between final and const. 4. Manipulate strings, lists, and maps. 5. Use loops and conditions to control flow. 6. Define and call functions with positional and named arguments, understand arrow syntax

Resources
To help you complete this handout, use the following resources: - Variables - Null Safety - Built-in types - Lists - Loops - Conditions - Functions

You can write you code on VS Code, or using this online editor - Install Dart and Flutter SDK - Online Dart Compiler

What You Need to Do
For each EXPLAIN: Answer the question your own words, and illutrate with a code example
2. For each CODE: Provide code examples that illustrate the concepts.
Handout Structure: Dart Syntax and Concepts
1. Type Inference
EXPLAIN : Explain how Dart infers the type of a variable.

CODE : Complete the bellow code to illustrate the concepts:

dart // Declare a int variable and let Dart infer its type // Define a variable with an explicit String type

2. Nullable and Non-Nullable Variables
EXPLAIN : Explain nullable vs non-nullable variables.

EXPLAIN : When is it useful to have nullable variables?

CODE : Complete the bellow code to illustrate the concepts:

```dart // Declare a nullable integer variable and assign it a null value

// Declare a non-nullable integer variable and assign it a value

// Assign a new value to the nullable variable ```

3. Final and const
EXPLAIN : Describe the difference between final and const.

CODE : Complete the bellow code to illustrate the concepts:

```dart // Declare a final variable and assign it the current date and time

// Can you declare this variable as const? Why?

// Declare a const variable with a integer value

// Can you reassign the value of this final variable? Why? ```

4. Strings, Lists and Maps
CODE : Complete the bellow code to illustrate the concepts:

Strings:

// Declare two strings: firstName and lastName and an integer:age

// Concatenate the 2 strings and the age 

// Print result
Lists:

// Create a list of integers

// Add a number to the list

// Remove a number from the list

// Insert a number at a specific index in the list

// Iterate over the list and print each number
Maps:

// Create a map with String keys and integer values

// Add a new key-value pair to the map

// Remove a key-value pair from the map

// Iterate over the map and print each key-value pair
5. Loops and Conditions
CODE : Complete the bellow code to illustrate the concepts:

```dart // Use a for-loop to print numbers from 1 to 5

// Use a while-loop to print numbers while a condition is true

// Use an if-else statement to check if a number is even or odd ```

6. Functions
EXPLAIN : Compare positional and named function arguments

EXPLAIN : Explain when and how to use arrow syntax for functions

CODE : Complete the bellow code to illustrate the concepts:

Defining and Invoking a Function:

// Define a function that takes two integers and returns their sum

// Call the function and print the result
Positional vs Named Arguments:

// Define a function that uses positional arguments

// Define another function that uses named arguments with the required keyword (ex: getArea with rectangle arguments)

// Call both functions with appropriate arguments
EXPLAIN : Can positional arguement be ommited? Show an example

EXPLAIN : Can named arguement be ommited? Show an example

Arrow Syntax:

// Define a function using arrow syntax that squares a number

// Call the arrow function and print the result
